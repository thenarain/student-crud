## Setup Instructions

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd student-crud
```

### Setup PostgreSQL Database

```bash
sudo -u postgres createdb studentdb
psql -U postgres -d studentdb -f backend/schema.sql
```

### Seed the Database with Sample Data

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```

This command inserts 20+ records into the `students`, `subjects`, and `marks` tables for testing.

Alternatively, you can seed manually:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d studentdb -f backend/sample_data.sql
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

### Run backend server

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Server will start on:
`http://localhost:4000`

### Run frontend app

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on:
`http://localhost:5173`

Open your browser and start managing members.
